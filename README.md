# fishpkgs

This is a drop-in replacement for all [fish](https://fishshell.com/) packages under [https://github.com/fishpkg/](https://github.com/fishpkg/).  The only difference is that the files have been moved into a `functions/` subdirectory so that the packages actually work with the [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) 4.2.0 or later.

Install with:

```
fisher install mbollmann/fishpkgs@main
```
